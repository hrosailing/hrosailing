hrosailing - Sailing made in Rostock
====================================

You can find the documentation [here](https://hrosailing.github.io/hrosailing/ "hrosailing").

### Compatibility 
[![Python 3.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)
[![Python 3.8](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)
[![Python 3.9](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

The `hrosailing` module might also be compatible (in large) with earlier versions of Python (`3.5`, `3.6`), together with some earlier
version of some of the used packages, namely `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`, aswell as Python `3.10`, but since it was released 
recently, we can't guarantee that.


### Installation

The recommended way to install `hrosailing` is with 
[pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/):
    
    pip install hrosailing

### License 

The `hrosailing` module is published under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/), see also [License](LICENSE)

### Examples

In the following we showcase via multiple examples some of the capabilities of the hrosailing module.
To avoid redundancies, all definitions of an example code might be used in the succeeding examples.

For a first example, we download some table with performance diagram data available [here](https://www.seapilot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/60ftmono.txt) and save it as testdata.csv.
This data is given in a tab seperated format which is supported by the keyword ```fmt=array``` of the ```from_csv``` method.
Since this data is only defined for wind angles between 0째 and 180째 we use the symmetrize function to obtain a symmetric polar diagram with wind angles between 0째 and 360째.

```python
import hrosailing.polardiagram as pol
pd = pol.from_csv("testdata.csv", fmt="array").symmetrize()
```

We can use the supported plot functions to get visualizations of the polar diagram.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ws = [10, 20, 30]

pd.plot_polar(ws=ws, ax=plt.subplot(2, 2, 1, projection="polar"))
pd.plot_convex_hull(ws=ws, ax=plt.subplot(2, 2, 2, projection="polar"))
pd.plot_flat(ws=ws, ax=plt.subplot(2, 2, 3))
pd.plot_color_gradient(ax=plt.subplot(2, 2, 4))

plt.show()
```

This results in the following matplotlib diagram:

We can also visualize the data in a three dimensional plot.

```python
pd.plot_3d()
plt.show()
```

Results in:

![3d_plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70914876/146153719-826e8c93-09ab-4387-b13c-e942139fcce6.png)

We can also directly iterate and/or evaluate the wind_angles, wind_speeds and boat_speeds of the polar diagram.
For example to artificially create random measurements.

```python
import numpy as np


def random_shifted_pt(pt, mul):
    pt = np.array(pt)
    rand = np.random.random(pt.shape) - 0.5
    rand *= np.array(mul)
    return pt + rand


data = np.array([
    random_shifted_pt([ws, wa, pd.boat_speeds[i, j]], [10, 5, 2])
    for i, ws in enumerate(pd.wind_angles)
    for j, wa in enumerate(pd.wind_speeds)
    for _ in range(6)
])
data = data[np.random.choice(len(data), size=500)]
```

In the following we treat ```data``` like some real life measurement data and try to obtain polar diagrams from it.
