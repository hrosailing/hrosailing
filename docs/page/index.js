To be precise, it calculates for a given cost density function cost and absolute function abs_cost int_0^l cost(s, t(s ds + abs_cost(t(l), l), where s is the distance travelled, l is the total distance from start to end and t(s) is the time travelled. t(s) is the solution of the initial value problem t(0) = 0, dt/ds = 1/bsp(s,t). The costs also depend on the weather forecast data, organized by a WeatherModel, distances are computed using the mercator projection Parameters      pd : PolarDiagram Polar diagram of the vessel start : tuple of two floats Coordinates of the starting point end : tuple of two floats Coordinates of the end point start_time : datetime.datetime The time at which the traveling starts wm : WeatherModel, optional The WeatherModel used cost_fun_dens : callable, optional Function giving a cost density for given time as datetime.datetime, lattitude as float, longitude as float and WeatherModel cost_fun_dens(t,lat,long,wm) corresponds to costs(s,t) above Defaults to  None cost_fun_abs : callable, optional Corresponds to  abs_costs Defaults to  lambda total_t, total_s: total_t integration_method : callable, optional Function that takes two (n,) arrays y, x and computes an approximative integral from that. Is only used if  cost_fun_dens is not None Defaults to  scipy.integrate.trapezoid im : InfluenceModel, optional The influence model used to consider additional influences on the boat speed Defaults to  None ivp_kw : Keyword arguments which will be passed to scipy.integrate.solve_ivp in order to solve the initial value problem described above Returns    - cost : float The total cost calculated as described above",
