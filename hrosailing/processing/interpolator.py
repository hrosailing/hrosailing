"""
Classes used for modular modelling of different interpolation methods.

Defines the `Interpolator` abstract base class that can be used to
create custom interpolation methods.

Subclasses of `Interpolator` can be used with:

- the `TableExtension` and `PointcloudExtension` classes in the
`hrosailing.pipeline` module,
- the `__call__`-methods of the `PolarDiagramTable` and `PolarDiagramPointcloud`
classes in the `hrosailing.polardiagram` module.

    For a given point :math:`grid\\\\_pt`, that is to be interpolated, we

    :math:`|| p[:2] - grid\\\\_pt ||`.
