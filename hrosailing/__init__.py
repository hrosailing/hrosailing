"""The hrosailing package is a Python library that provides assistance for the
scientific aspects of sailing.
Currently, it implements the data processing framework described
[here](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/6/3085) and will be extended in the
future.

In particular, hrosailing provides:

- four kinds of representations of polar diagrams,
- serialization and visualization of polar diagrams,
- creation of polar diagrams from measurement data using
a modular pipeline model and suitable data science methods,
- wind conversion,
- suggesting optimal tacks and jibes,
- calculating the costs of a sailing trip with respect to the
weather on the way,
- calculating isocrone points with respect to the weather along the way.
