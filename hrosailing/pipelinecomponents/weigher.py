"""
Contains the baseclass for Weighers used in the PolarPipeline class,
that can also be used to create custom Weighers.

Also contains two predefined and useable weighers, the CylindricMeanWeigher
and the CylindricMemberWeigher, aswell as the WeightedPoints class, used to
represent data points together with their respective weights
