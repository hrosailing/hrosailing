# TODO 

## For version 1.0.0

- [ ] Add Contributing.md
- [ ] Fix style problems due to conversion from pdoc3 to pdoc
- [ ] Complete the testsuite
- [ ] Make convex_direction and cruising available for interpolated slices
- [ ] Add API for forwarding slice keywords in `convex_direction` and `cruising`
- [ ] implement functional `PolarDiagramMultiSails`
- [ ] create classes inheriting from matplotlib for doing the plotting
- [ ] overhaul slicing logic
- [ ] refactor `globe_model`, `weather_model`, `data` and `influence_model` into new submodule

## Ideas after version 1.0.0

- [ ] More examples in documentation
- [ ] Add 'Getting started' section to first site of documentation
- [ ] Make functional links to referenced submodules, classes, exceptions and methods
- [ ] Find a way to read grib-files in python
- [ ] Implement more pipeline components, in particular useful `InfluenceModel`-Subclasses
- [ ] improve the coloring-API for PolarDiagramMultiSails
- [ ] support different globe projections for the cruising functions
- [ ] plotting support for other objects than polar diagrams

## Visions

- [ ] online version of data processing
- [ ] parallel data processing
- [ ] integration of relational data bases
- [ ] fully featured weather routing support
- [ ] `hrosailing` as console application
- [ ] integration of sophisticated machine learning techniques such as neural networks
- [ ] integration of up to date wave models (cooperation with [Mathieu Dutour Sikiric](https://github.com/MathieuDutSik)?)
- [ ] Virtual sailing for algorithm testing and competitions
- [ ] Tutorial
